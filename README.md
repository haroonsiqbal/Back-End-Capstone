# FIRE SAFE

# INTRODUCTION

Fire Safe is an application for creating an inventory of your personal possessions in case of loss during a fire, natural disaster, or other emergency. By using Fire Safe, you will have a complete list of all your belongings and their value, which can aid in the process of replacing your items or filing an insurance claim.

# LOGIN AND REGISTRATION

To begin using Fire Safe, you must register for a new account. Enter your name, email address, and password to create a new account. If you have already created an account, log in using your email address and password to be taken to your personalized dashboard.

# HOME PAGE

Upon logging in, the user will be redirected to the homepage. To begin creating an inventory, click the My Inventory link. To add additional merchants, click the Merchants link. To add information relating to your own insurance policy, click the My Insurance link. In addition, the user can click their email address in the top right corner of the nav bar to edit personal information related to their account. While using the application, the user can return to the home page at any time by clicking the Fire Safe logo at the top left corner of the nav bar.

# MY INVENTORY PAGE

Upon clicking the My Inventory link, users will be directed to their personal inventory. For new users, the inventory will be empty as no items have been added yet. To begin adding items to the inventory, the user should click the Add New Item link at the top of the page. 

For each item that the user wishes to log, the user should fill out all applicable information, including the name, manufacturer, model, category, price, quantity, date purchased, and seller of the product. The list of categories is pre-defined and will be automatically populated in the dropdown menu. The list of sellers is also pre-populated, but if necessary the user can add additional merchants by clicking the Merchants link. Note: New merchants must be added first before they will populate in the dropdown menu. The comment field is not required but provides space for the user to include additional specifications or important information about the product as needed. In addition, the user can upload an image of the product or a receipt of the purchase by clicking the Choose File button near the bottom of the entry and selecting the appropriate file to upload.

Once all information has been entered, the user should click the Create button, which will save the entry and redirect the user to the index page. The user will see that the new item has been added to the inventory, including a thumbnail of the picture. To see the full list of information for the item, including a larger version of the photo, the user can click the Details link next to the item. To update or change any information for an item, the user should click the Edit link, update the information as necessary, and click the Save button. To delete an item in its entirety, the user should click the Delete link next to the item and confirm the deletion by clicking the red delete button at the bottom of the entry. In both cases of Edit and Delete, the user will be redirected to the Index Page, which will display the updated results.

Note: Inventories are private and are not viewable by other users.

# MERCHANTS PAGE

A pre-populated list of merchants is available in the dropdown menu when logging a new item. If the user wishes to select a merchant that is not included in the list, however, the user can add the merchant by visiting the Merchants page. On the Merchants page, the user will see a list of all retailers that are already included in the database. To add a new merchant, the user should click the Add New Merchant link at the top of the page. The user should enter the name of the merchant to add and click the Create button. The user will be redirected to the index page, where the new merchant will appear at the bottom of the list.

When a user navigates to the My Inventory page, the merchant they added will appear in the dropdown menu and can be selected when creating a new item. Note: The list of retailers is not specific to individual users and all added merchants will be viewable by other users.

# MY INSURANCE PAGE

On the My Insurance page, users can add information related to their specific insurance policy. As with the My Inventory page, the My Insurance page will initially be empty for new users. To add a new policy, users should click the Add New Policy link at the top of the page. Users should complete information relating to their policy, including the insurance provider, policy number, type of insurance, maximum coverage amount, and start and end dates for their policy. There is also an optional field to include information about any additional riders or details related to the policy. When finished, the user should click the Create button, which will redirect the user to the index page.

The newly added policy will be displayed on the index page. To see additional details, such as rider information, the user should click the Details link for that policy. Policies can also be edited and deleted using the Edit and Delete links, respectively.

Note: Insurance information is private and is not viewable by other users.

# LOG OUT

When finished using the application, the user should click the Log Out button at the top right corner of the nav bar. This will end the user's session and return the user to the home page. The user can begin another session by clicking the Login link on the nav bar.
